Fix a storage class bug in registering dataset types in ``pipetask run``.

Prior to this fix, the presence of multiple storage classes being associated with the same dataset type in a pipeline could cause the registered dataset type's storage class to be random and nondeterministic in regular `pipetask run` execution (but not quantum-backed butler execution).
It now follows the rules set by `PipelineGraph`, in which the definition in the task that produces the dataset wins.
