If ``pipetask`` is run with multiple processes and if a butler datastore cache is configured, all subprocesses will now share the same cache.
For large numbers of simultaneous processes it may be necessary to significantly increase the number of datasets in the cache to make the cache usable.
This can be done by using the ``$DAF_BUTLER_CACHE_EXPIRATION_MODE`` environment variable.

Previously each subprocess would get its own cache and if ``fork`` start method was used these cache directories would not be cleaned up.
