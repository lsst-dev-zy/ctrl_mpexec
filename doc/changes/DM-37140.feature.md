Be more permissive about input/output collection consistency, and provide `--rebase` option to force consistency.

An existing output collection is now considered consistent with a given sequence of input collections if the latter is a contiguous subsequence of the former.
When this is not the case, `--rebase` redefines the output collection such that it will be.
