Upgrade QuantumGraphExecutionReport to handle multiple overlapping graphs.

Update the `pipetask report` command-line interface to accommodate the new
`QuantumProvenanceGraph`. This allows for resolving outcomes of processing over
multiple attempts (and associated graphs) over the same dataquery, providing
information on recoveries, persistent issues and mismatch errors.
