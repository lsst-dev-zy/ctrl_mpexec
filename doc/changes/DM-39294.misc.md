The current pipeline directed graph nodes use dark gray as their background color.
It has been reported that it is difficult to read the black text on the dark gray background.
This ticket updates the directed graph color scheme with an aim towards making node text easier to read.
In the process of exploring what color schemes would be optimal to satisfy the aim of this ticket, it emerged that making use of the Rubin visual identity colors may be desirable.
This will help to make LSST pipeline graphs more instantly recognizable as Rubin-associated products.
