``pipetask qgraph`` can now generate a standalone "execution butler" which is a SQLite registry with all the expected outputs pre-filled in registry.  Using this registry allow ``pipetask run`` to execute without touching the main registry whilst still writing file artifacts to the standard location.  It is not yet configured to allow a completely detached processing using a local datastore but this can be changed manually after creation to use a chained datastore.
