Added SeparablePipelineExecutor, a pipeline executor midway in capability between SimplePipelineExecutor and CmdLineFwk.
SeparablePipelineExecutor is designed to be run from Python, and lets the caller decide when each pipeline processing step is carried out.
It also allows certain pipeline steps to be customized by passing alternate implementations of execution strategies (e.g., custom graph builder).
